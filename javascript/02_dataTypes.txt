1. There are eight basic data types in JavaScript;
2. Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.
3. Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Object, Symbol;
4. The object type is special. All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
5. The result of typeof null is "object". That’s an officially recognized error in typeof behavior, coming from the early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, null is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own.
6. There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

- number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
- bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
- string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
- boolean for true/false.
- null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
- undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
- object for more complex data structures.
- symbol for unique identifiers.
