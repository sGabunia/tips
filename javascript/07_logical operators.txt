1. There are three logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT).
2. he OR || operator does the following:

Evaluates operands from left to right.
For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.

3. The AND && operator does the following:

Evaluates operands from left to right.
For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.
When all values are truthy, the last value is returned;
