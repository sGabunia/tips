1. Numeric conversion happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.
For example, when division / is applied to non-numbers: "6" / "2" = 3;
2. If the string is not a valid number, the result of such a conversion is NaN.
3. String(value), Number(value), Boolean(value);
4. Please note: the string with zero "0" is true;
5. 0, null, undefined, Nan, "" - false;
